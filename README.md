# purescript-web-file-directory-entries

Type definitions and implementation for the
[*File and Directory Entries API* WICG Draft Report](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api).

This library is incomplete. It currently contains the read-only portion of the
*File and Directory Entries API* which
we needed to implement drag-and-drop file upload on a web page, where the
“file” being uploaded can be an entire directory tree.

There is another portion of the *File and Directory Entries API* concerned
with writing to a file system, and that portion we have not implemented.

Pull requests welcome!
